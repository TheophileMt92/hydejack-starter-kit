    Hi, I’m Theo! I am a data analyst and researcher with a PhD in macroecology from the University Claude Bernard Lyon I, France.<br><br>
    My journey has taken me through crown institutes, universities, and international organisations. My research portfolio includes (1) unraveling the responses of biodiversity to global change factors and (2) contributing to pioneering marine spatial planning initiatives.<br><br>
    Adept in scientific writing and utilizing advanced programming and computer modelling tools, I've consistently transformed data or ideas, into impactful research findings. Now, I'm eager to broaden my horizons, stepping into leadership roles, program management or coordination, expert analyses and engaging with diverse audiences, including developing nations, NGOs, and human intelligence networks.<br><br>
    My focus extends beyond research – I'm deeply committed to biodiversity protection, tackling IUU fishing, and addressing labor abuses at sea. I'm enthusiastic about connecting with like-minded professionals and organizations to make a meaningful impact on the world's ecological and social challenges. Let's collaborate for a sustainable and resilient future!
